Welcome to Aletheia â€” an ongoing and evolving project aimed at exploring the intersection of creativity and artificial intelligence. This repository contains selected Kotlin and XML files that represent the core functionality and user experience of the application. Please note that this is not the full project, and it is not intended to be open-source or publicly distributed at this time.

Aletheia is a mobile application designed to empower users to craft stories, invent fictional worlds, and generate visual illustrations for them with the help of AI. It blends the imaginative potential of narrative creation with the expressive capabilities of modern machine learning tools, all within a socially interactive platform inspired by the dynamics of social media.

The project is currently under active development, and these shared files are intended solely to provide insight into the app's architecture and main features.

If you have any questions, feedback, or would like to discuss potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out via email at cealdan.dev@gmail.com.

Thank you for your interest and understanding.
